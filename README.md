# bibToCOI
## original author: Paul Rosen <paul.rosen@utah.edu>

Python application that converts authors from bibtex to a list of potential COIs (e.g., for NSF)

Usage: python bibToCOI.py <year> <bibfile>

Provide a <bibfile> that lists your publications and the <year> to filter from, and it will produce a csv for authors you may be in conflict with.
